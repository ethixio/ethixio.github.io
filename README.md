Identity. Ownership. Licensing. Content by the people, for the people. This is the Ethereum Information Exchange; an ethically constrained platform for creators and consumers.

## Motivation and Background
SoundCloud is failing. End to end free content doesn't pay well. But, it is an amazing service on numerous levels. Meanwhile, unconstrained free content supplied by p2p networks have no control mechanisms and are therefore featureless (beyond core upload/download) and run rampant with copyright violation. On the other end of the spectrum, centralized digital distributors take a hefty cut of profits. Even YouTube, full of free content and feature rich, moves towards monitization strategies that degrade the user experience. People create content. They want to share that content. Sometimes with only a few others. Sometimes they want to sell it. We no longer need a single entity to control how we do that.
